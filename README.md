Ionic App Base
=====================

A Sample project in Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

Idea of this sample project is to demonstrate a code snippet. This will only explain the how objects are defined, referred and how the work flow happens. 


## Note
Please note that this will not work independently and is not meant to run as my project has been modified just for viewing purpose.
